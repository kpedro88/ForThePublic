## Research and Technical Experience

* Joined the CMS collaboration in 2005. Research focus: search for physics beyond the Standard Model at the LHC, especially for Supersymmetry and Dark Matter.
    * Founding member of an analysis group with members from Fermilab/UCSD/UCSB, focusing on final states with leptons.
    * Supervised several Fermilab postdoctoral researchers.
    * Current postdoctoral researcher Matteo Cremonesi is searching for Dark Matter with the CMS detector.


* Extensive experience in operating large distributed computing infrastructures: operated the entire CMS computing resources in LHC Run 1 leading up to the Higgs discovery with a team of 60 individuals distributed across the world
* Part of the worldwide community efforts to plan for the software and computing infrastucture for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC): I was an integral part of the community planning process and my input was documented in the [Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982). I was editor of the [HEP Software Foundation Community White Paper Working Group - Data Analysis and Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03983).
* My recent research interest in computing infrastructure explores if analysis in HEP can be conducted more efficiently using tools developed and used by industry. I am exploring using toolkits like [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and similar technologies. I created a research group spanning researchers from Fermilab, CERN and the Universities Princeton, Padova and Vanderbilt. The [CMS Big Data Project](https://cms-big-data.github.io/) also very closely works together with industry, latest in a project with [Intel](https://www.intel.com/) in the context of [CERN openlab](https://openlab.cern/).
* I am currently the U.S. CMS Software and Computing Operations Program deputy manager enabling analysis of U.S. collaborators of the CMS experiment. I am overseeing the operation of the U.S. CMS Tier-1 site at Fermilab and 7 U.S. Tier-2 sites at Caltech, Florida University, MIT, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Purdue University, UC San Diego, Unversity of Wisconsin-Madison. I lead effort to administer the sites, maintain the computing infrastructure and conduct strategic R&D projects.
* In 2015, the CMS collaboration appointed me Focus Area Lead for Services and Infrastructure in the CMS Software and Computing project. I am coordinating the efforts of the worldwide submission infrastructure, innovative new ways of using resources at commercial clouds and supercomputing centers, and the development of computing insfrastructure services like data management and workflow management systems.
